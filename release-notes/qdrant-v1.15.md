## Web-UI ðŸŽ¨

* https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-web-ui/releases/tag/v0.1.41 - New "Create Collection" form, Simplify JWT form, other fixes

## Deprecations ðŸš§

* `init_from` parameter of the collection creation API is deprecated and going to be removed in v1.16
    * Reason: `init_from` creates false expectation of data consistency and reliability of this operation.
    * Alternative: prefer usage of [migration tool](https://github.com/qdrant/migration) or [snapshots](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/snapshots/), read more in the [tutorial](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/database-tutorials/migration)
* Payload based filters in JWT going to be removed in v1.16
    * Reason: Payload based filters are inconsistent for read/write operations. Many update operations are not implemented due to security risks and complexity. Lack of real-life usage.
    * Alternative: prefer collection-based access control.
* `mmap_threshold` parameter of the collection optimizer is deprecated and going to be removed in v1.16
    * Reason: starting from v1.12, all vector storages exclusively use memory maps, explicit usage of `mmap_threshold` is obsolete
    * Alternative: control memory cache behaviour of Qdrant storages with `on_disk: true/false` parameter
* [Lock API](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/administration/#locking) is deprecated and going to be removed in v1.16
    * Reason: lack of real-life usage
    * Alternative: JWT tokens can be configured to provide read-only access to Qdrant

* https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/pull/6760 - Removed `max_indexing_threads` from config
