## Features :ring:

* https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/pull/1981 https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/pull/1996 https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/pull/2011 - Lookup in grouping requests. Allows to keep shared group info in a dedicated collection to minimize memory usage.
* https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/pull/2009 - Self-hosted Web UI. Just open `http://localhost:6333/dashboard` in your browser to see the dashboard. In the first version, it includes collection viewer and interactive query editor with autocomplete.
* https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/pull/2024 - Experimental :microscope: - support for asynchronous IO with `io_uring`, a feature of recent Linux kernels. Significantly improves performance on network-mounted storages.
* https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/pull/2070 - Oversampling allows to retrieve more points using quantized vectors and then re-score them using original ones. Allows to tune speed/accuracy tradeoff in the query time.
